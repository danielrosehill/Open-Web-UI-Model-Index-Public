*Last Updated: March 20, 2025*

This repository is a collection of AI System Prompts and Assistants that I've been sharing publicly since 2024. Inside, you'll find prompts ready to be used on any compatible AI platform. They're designed to be easily imported into OpenWebUI â€“ just head to the provided URL and click "Import" (after you've set your instance URL in OpenWebUI, which it will remember for next time).

## What's Inside?

You'll find a mix of tools here, from practical text reformatters and data entry helpers to more specialized, character-based assistants. 

I've kept things straightforward, without getting bogged down in excessive categories or technical jargon. Most AI enthusiasts will instinctively know which models play nicely with RAG pipelines or need external tools. Given how quickly the AI landscape is changing, detailed implementation guides would be outdated in no time!

To keep things simple and focused, I've also left out specific foundation model names and parameter settings. 

### Temperature Settings

For general text-processing, I often have good results with a temperature of 0.3, but feel free to experiment to find what works best for you. 

### Real Time Information Retrieval And RAG

For tasks that need up-to-the-minute information, models like Perplexity Sonar can be really effective because they handle context retrieval so well. I'm hoping more models will move in this direction, making it easier to manage system configurations while boosting information retrieval.

### Vision

Finally, some of the configurations require vision capability, and a few require other multimodal capabilities like audio and video processing. 

My instinct is that within a very short period of time, almost all major LLMs will be multimodal by default. But for now, if you spotted a configuration requires vision, then enable it. 

## Repository Structure

- `source-data/models.csv`: The primary data source containing all model information
- `individual-configs/`: Individual markdown files for each model
- `converted/models.json`: JSON representation of the models data
- `scripts/`: Scripts for maintaining and updating the repository
